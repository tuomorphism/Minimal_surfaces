    "# From Geometry to Convexity: Formulating the Minimal Surface Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",

    "In the previous chapter, we introduced the mathematical machinery of Dirac-δ forms, differential forms, and vector fields in differential geometry. Now, we’ll put that machinery to work and formulate the Plateau problem as a convex optimization problem —the foundation of the minimal surface algorithm developed by Wang and Chern.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the authors state, this convex formulation bypasses the need for meshes or parametric surface representations. It works directly in the ambient space, supports topological flexibility, and is robust under numerical discretization. Most importantly, it guarantees convergence to the global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Classical Plateau Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The original problem statement was \"given a closed curve $\\Gamma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$, find a surface $\\Sigma$ with boundary $\\partial \\Sigma = \\Gamma$ that minimizes the area\". In other words, find the \"soap film surface\" for a given wireframe. Mathematically, the problem can be stated as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{\\Sigma : \\partial \\Sigma = \\Gamma} \\text{Area}(\\Sigma)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as the authors state, this version of them problem is difficult because:\n",
    "- The space of surfaces is non-convex, i.e. no clear direction for minimum surface area\n",
    "- Topology matters: different surfaces with the same boundary can have different numbers of holes\n",
    "- Mesh-based methods are unstable if the topology is incorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "These difficulties can however be overcome if we formalize the surface not as a strict geometric object, but rather as a dirac-delta distribution. Formally, we represent a surface $\\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ by a 1-form $\\delta_\\Sigma \\in \\Omega^2(M)$. Similarly, we can represent the boundary curve $\\Gamma$ by a 2-form $\\delta_\\Gamma \\in \\Omega^1(M)$. As a reminder, $\\Omega^k(M)$ denotes the set of smooth differential $k$-forms on the manifold $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dirac-delta forms satisfy these integral properties,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_M \\omega \\wedge \\delta_\\Sigma = \\int_\\Sigma \\omega\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_M \\eta \\wedge \\delta_\\Gamma = \\int_\\Gamma \\eta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Therefore, the dirac-delta forms $\\delta_\\Gamma$ and $\\delta_\\Sigma$ characterize the geometric objects in a weak sense. Similar to weak solutions of partial differential equations.  \n",
    "Using these forms, the original authors reformulate the problem by defining a mass norm for a 1-form $\\eta$, $\\| \\eta \\|_{\\text{mass}} = \\sup_{\\omega \\in \\Omega^2(M), \\|\\omega\\|_{\\max} \\leq 1} \\int_M \\omega \\wedge \\eta$. Then, the original problem is just to find the surface representation form with minimum $\\| \\delta_\\Sigma \\|_{\\text{mass}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Rewriting the Boundary Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "For enforcing the boundary condition $\\partial \\Sigma = \\Gamma$, the authors derive the following weak formulation using a \"test\" 1-form $\\eta$ and Stoke's theorem, stating that for any such test form must hold \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_\\Gamma \\eta = \\int_\\Sigma d\\eta = \\int_M d\\eta \\wedge \\delta_\\Sigma = \\int_M \\eta \\wedge d\\delta_\\Sigma\n",
    "\\Rightarrow d\\delta_\\Sigma = \\delta_\\Gamma\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the boundary constraint becomes simply $d \\delta_\\Sigma = \\delta_\\Gamma$, which is a constraint based on the exterior derivative operator $d$. Most importantly, the exterior derivative is a linear operator, making the boundary constraint a linear differential constraint. More details on this can be found in the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Relaxing the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’re minimizing $\\| \\delta_\\Sigma \\|_{\\text{mass}}$ subject to $d\\delta_\\Sigma = \\delta_\\Gamma$. But we only allow $\\delta_\\Sigma$ that comes from actual surfaces. The obvious relaxation for the problem is optimizing over all possible 1-forms which satisfy the boundary constraint. As the authors detail, this relaxed version of the problem gives the same value as the non-relaxed version, but now we have much more flexibility in the search space. Formally, the final optimization problem is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\min_{\\eta \\in \\Omega^1(M), \\ d\\eta = \\delta_\\Gamma} \\| \\eta \\|_{\\text{mass}}\n",
    "}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation of the problem is convex and has a linear constraint, making it easier to crack using standard non-linear optimization methods. In the original paper, this formulation is represented as problem ???.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Topological Considerations: Periodic Domains and Cohomology\n",
    "\n",
    "To accelerate computation, we implement the solver to work in a periodic box $M = \\mathbb{T}^3$ (i.e., a 3D torus). This allows use of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to solve the necessary PDE constraints efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this introduces new challenges:\n",
    "- Surfaces that wrap around the domain may satisfy $d\\eta = \\delta_\\Gamma$, even if they don't produce a true surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$\n",
    "- The solution space includes multiple cohomology classes, each representing a different homology type of surface, i.e. surfaces might have different number of holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To eliminate these ambiguities, we fix the cohomology class by computing the projected area vector:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\int_\\Sigma N_\\Sigma \\, dS = \\frac{1}{2} \\oint_\\Gamma \\gamma \\times d\\gamma\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and enforcing these additional constraints, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_M \\vartheta_i \\wedge \\star \\eta = A_i,i = 1,2,3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vartheta_i = dx_i$, and each $A_i$ corresponds to the signed projected area onto the $yz$, $zx$, and $xy$ planes respectively. These constraints ensure that the solution corresponds to a surface that can exist in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ rather than wrapping around $\\mathbb{T}^3$. See **Section 2.6** and **Appendix B** of the original paper for full details on how these constraints reduce the admissible set to embedded surfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "After including these cohomology constraints, the optimization problem becomes this\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{\\eta \\in \\Omega^1(M), \\ d\\eta = \\delta_\\Gamma, A_i = \\int_M dx_i \\wedge \\star \\eta} \\| \\eta \\|_{\\text{mass}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "As the original authors describe, we can further simplify the optimization problem by using the Helmoltz-Hodge decomposition on $\\eta$. We can write the full 1-form $\\eta$ as a sum of an initial guess term $\\eta_0$ and some form which is the result of applying exterior derivative to a smooth scalar function. In other words, we can write $\\eta = \\eta_0 + d\\phi$, where $\\phi \\in C^\\infty(M)$. The initial guess $\\eta_0 \\in \\Omega^1(M)$ is a 1-form and also must satisfy both the boundary constraint: $d\\eta_0 = \\delta_\\Gamma$ and the cohomology constraints: $\\int_M dx_i \\wedge \\star \\eta_0 = A_i$ for $i=1,2,3$\n",
    " \n",
    "We can now write the final formulation of the problem, which is numbered as problem 6 in the original paper,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&\\min_{\\phi \\in C^\\infty(M)} \\| \\eta_0 + d\\phi \\|_{\\text{mass}} \\\\\n",
    "&\\text{where } \\eta_0 \\in \\Omega^1(M) \\text{ satisfies:} \\\\\n",
    "&\\quad d\\eta_0 = \\delta_\\Gamma \\\\\n",
    "&\\quad \\int_M dx_i \\wedge \\star \\eta_0 = A_i, \\quad i = 1,2,3\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve transformed the Plateau problem from a nonlinear, hard-to-solve geometric variational problem into a problem which\n",
    "\n",
    "- is a convex optimization over 1-forms\n",
    "- has linear PDE constraints\n",
    "- is efficiently solvable using Fast Fourier Transform in the periodic domain $\\mathbf{T}^3$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the next post, we’ll look at how to implement the required mathematical tools in Python using numpy. After we have successfully built the implementations of the different tools, we combine the theoretical groundwork we made in this post and the actual implementations to solve the problem numerically. We can then see that the approach created by the original authors truly works in this alternate techical landscape."
